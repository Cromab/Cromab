- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cromab
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and all things data. I'm a set theorist at heart, but love statistics and numeric analysis as well. I ocassionally add personal projects I'm working on outside of work or school here, and typically like to include new libraries or techs that I'm learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of AWS to improve my online tabletop game I GM for. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting challenges and projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... a message might help!
