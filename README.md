- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cromab
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and all things data. I'm a statistician at heart, but love machine learning and numeric analysis as well. I ocassionally add personal projects I'm working on outside of work or school here, and typically like to include new libraries or techs that I'm learning.
- 🌱 I most recently learned the ins and outs of the Librosa library to aid in a project I was working on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting challenges and projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... a message might help!
